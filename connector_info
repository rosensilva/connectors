In latest version we have added following: Previously we were creating a single pool for each cluster operation and closing it after each operation that's why read/write lock issue occurs (jmxRegister and jmxUnRegister on the same object). This Pr rectifies that and also avoids closing JedisCluster after each operation since It's no need to close the JedisCluster instance as it is handled by the JedisClusterConnectionPool itself.
